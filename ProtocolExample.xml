<!-- instructionns:  This XML file defines a protocol consisting of four
 steps: Hybridization, Bleach, Imaging, and Wash. Each step consists 
 of a series of commands that move the CNC router to a specific well 
 or buffer position, run the peristaltic pump for a specified time
  and speed, and pause for a specified amount of time before moving
   on to the next step.

The move commands for the hybridization step move the CNC router to each 
well on the 96-well plate in order, and the move commands for the bleach, 
imaging, and wash steps move the CNC router to the corresponding buffer 
positions. The pump commands specify the speed and duration of the
 peristaltic pump, and the pause commands introduce a pause between
  steps to allow for any necessary manual intervention.
  
  
  You will want to build out this protocol for each round of hybridization and adjust the 
  pause time after the hybiridzation rounds to account for image acquisition
